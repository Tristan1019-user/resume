  <h2>Security-Focused Infrastructure & Automation</h2>

  <p>
    This site documents a self-hosted security lab designed to demonstrate
    network segmentation, detection engineering, and automated response.
  </p>

  <h3>Network Architecture</h3>
  <p>
    This diagram shows trust boundaries, VLAN segmentation, and enforced access
    paths within the lab environment.

  <h3>Detection, Decision, and Response Pipeline</h3>
  <p>
    This diagram illustrates how telemetry flows from sensors through analysis,
    automation, and enforcement.

  <h3>CVE Detection and Vulnerability Correlation</h3>
  <p>
    This diagram outlines how vulnerability scan results are correlated with
    system telemetry to identify exposed services, prioritize risk, and
    generate actionable security events.
  </p>
  <p>
    The focus is on separating continuous vulnerability assessment from
    real-time detection, while still enabling automated alerting and response
    when high-risk conditions are identified.
